TITLE XXXIX
COMMERCIAL RELATIONS
CHAPTER 668
ELECTRONIC COMMERCE
PART I
ELECTRONIC SIGNATURES
668.004 Force and effect of electronic signature.—Unless otherwise provided by law, an electronic signature may be used to sign a writing and shall have the same force and effect as a written signature.

PART II
UNIFORM ELECTRONIC
TRANSACTION ACT
668.50	Uniform Electronic Transaction Act.
(12) RETENTION OF ELECTRONIC RECORDS; ORIGINALS.—
(a) If a law requires that a record be retained, the requirement is satisfied by retaining an electronic record of the information in the record which:
1. Accurately reflects the information set forth in the record after the record was first generated in final form as an electronic record or otherwise.
2. Remains accessible for later reference.
(d) If a provision of law requires a record to be presented or retained in its original form, or provides consequences if the record is not presented or retained in its original form, that law is satisfied by an electronic record retained in accordance with paragraph (a).

98.461	Registration application, precinct register; contents. states
...  or, when voter registration information, including the voter’s signature, is maintained digitally or on electronic, magnetic, or optic media, such stored information may be substituted for the original registration application. 
As the petition form includes the ability to register to vote, and title.ix.98.461 specifies the voter's registration information including the signature may be digitally reproduced and used as a substitute for the original, the petition form itself must also have the same validity, being the same form.

### Governing the forms themselves
Part of the form specification is in Florida rule 1S-2.009 Constitutional Amendment by Initiative Petition. Crucially, (2).(b) requires the format of the petition form is deemed sufficient only if the petition form:
1. Is printed on separate cards or individual sheets of paper. The minimum size of such forms shall be 3 inches by 5 inches and the maximum shall be 8 1/2 inches by 11 inches.
This minimally implies that the submitted form should probably be printed out before submission to the Supervisor of Elections in the appropriate county of residence of the registered voter.
In the same rule (1S-2.009), reproduction via the internet is allowed as specified by (7)
(7) Reproduction. Petition forms may be reproduced in newspapers, magazines, and other forms of printed mass media or made available through the internet for download printing, provided such forms are reproduced in the same format as approved by the Secretary of State. The petition forms may be included within a larger advertisement, provided the forms are clearly defined by a solid or broken line border.

The requirement for original signatures are specified by 
1S-2.0091 Constitutional Amendment Initiative Petition; Submission Deadline; Signature Verification.
(2).(b) The Supervisor shall not verify as valid a signature on an initiative petition form unless all of the following information is contained on the petition form:
1. The voter’s name,
2. The voter’s address (including city and county),
3. The voter’s date of birth or voter registration number,
4. The voter’s original signature, and
5. The date the voter signed the petition, as recorded by the voter.

So the open question is whether the two requirements are necessarily tied together? Can the form be digitally reproduced with the electronic signature and then printed on separate pieces of paper, satisfying both the requirements of 1S-2.009-1 and also 1S-2.0091-(2).(b).4 through the mechanism of 1S-2.009-(7)?

### The pitch
The idea was to attempt to adhere to both the printed paper requirement from 1S-2.009 via a final printing process and also utilize the validity of electronic signatures to satisfy the "original signature" requirement from 1S-2.0091. In simple language a user would fill out the name and address information via an online form, likely text based but possibly using handwriting. Then, the user would create a handwriting based signature. So on a phone, this would be using your finger to draw out your signature. Upon submission, the official form would be filled out with all the fields matched up to the required places. Finally, to satisfy the printing requirement, the digitally signed document would be printed out and mailed or hand delivered to the Supervisor of Elections in the registered voter's county. The end product would represent the intent of the voter to support the initiative and look identical to a document prepared via more traditional methods by the time the Supervisor of Elections received it.

Supporting this thesis I would point out 1S-2.009 section (7) which states 
(7) Reproduction. Petition forms may be reproduced in newspapers, magazines, and other forms of printed mass media or made available through the internet for download printing, provided such forms are reproduced in the same format as approved by the Secretary of State. The petition forms may be included within a larger advertisement, provided the forms are clearly defined by a solid or broken line border.

At all times the reproduction would adhere to the format approved by the Secretary of State, but the language supporting internet reproduction for printing seems to support the system.

Other supporting information includes Florida Statutes Title IX, CHAPTER 98 - REGISTRATION OFFICE, OFFICERS, AND PROCEDURES:
Section 98.461 labeled "Registration application, precinct register; contents" states
...  or, when voter registration information, including the voter’s signature, is maintained digitally or on electronic, magnetic, or optic media, such stored information may be substituted for the original registration application. 
As the petition form includes the ability to register to vote, and Title IX 98.461 specifies the voter's registration information including the signature may be digitally reproduced and used as a substitute for the original, the petition form itself must also have the same validity, being the same form.
